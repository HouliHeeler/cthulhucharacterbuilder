Character Creation Tool for Call of Cthulhu 7e

Description

    This project was built to make the character creation process for the tabletop Role Playing Game Call of Cthulhu a straightforward process. It is specifically adapted for the 7th edition ruleset.

Language Choices

    React was chosen to set up this project because it was a language that I wanted to spend a lot more time with. The project gave me a chance to use functionalities of it that I had not come across before, such as React-Select and ReactDND.

Future of this Project

    This project has a lot more room to grow if I decide to pursue it further. In its current state, it can be used to build one character sheet, print it, and repeat when necessary.

    Further functionality might include the following:

    -Buildout of a backend for User Log-In, Multiple Character Creation and Storage

    -The ability to switch between different rulesets, or even different gaming systems

    -Ability to use the character sheet to play the game itself, keeping track of ongoing stat changes, and making randomized rolls for your characters actions

Reflections

    For a seemingly simple project, there were a lot of things that took a great amount of learning, and trial and error, to get where I needed them to be. This has given me a much better grasp on React than I started with, and gave me the realization that there is still much more to learn within React, and that I am looking forward to the process.
